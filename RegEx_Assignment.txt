Messing with text
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part I - Regex Golf is an exercise of trying to find the shortest
regular expression that matches all strings in one given set, but does
not match any of the strings in a different given set. Like golf, a
lower score is better.

For example, this is the content of the file "golf_00":

00 one
01 two
02 three

00 four
01 five
02 six

The goal is to find a regex that will match the top set (one, two,
three), but not match ANY of the bottom set (four, five, six).

This will work:  grep -E 'one|two|three' golf_00

But that regex took 13 characters - Not a good score

This is better:  grep -E 't|n' golf_00

That regex took 3 characters - A much better score.

I have given you 9 holes to play (golf_01 .. golf_09).

 - You can ONLY use the -E flag. No -v or -o flags allowed!
 - They get harder as you go on. 
 - Bonus points for the lowest score.
 - The approximate pars are listed below.
 - Some holes can be played under par. Some not.
 - If you are stuck, I have given you some helpful(?) clues in golf_HINTS

Hole | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 |
---------------------------------------------------
Par  | 3  | 5  | 3  | 6  | 5  | 9  | 8  | 12 | 7  |   Total = 58


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part II - Find and download a big chunk of English text (8000 lines at
least) from Project Gutenberg:

http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/

Download the Plain text (us-ascii or Plain Text UTF-8) version.

Determine the letter frequency distribution for that chunk of text
(convert everything to lowercase).

Determine the 5 most common WORDS in the text with length >= 7 letters
(ignore case).

Determine the longest word in the text. If there is more than one list
them all

------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part III - Real or Fake

You are given 5 coded messages (code1.txt ... code5.txt).  The messages
are coded with a simple character substitution (i.e. x = a, 2 = e, for
ALL occurrences of "x" and "2" in the message).  Each file has a
different substitution.  All of the inter-word spaces and punctuation
have been removed and case is ignored.

Look at the letter frequency distribution of each message and see how
it compares (in relative numbers) to what you determined in Part II.

Determine which of the 5 coded messages are real messages and which
ones are decoy messages of garbage (random letters).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write your answers to a plain text file (do not use WORD) and name it:
FirstLast_Words.txt (i.e. TobySmith_Words.txt). 

You can also cut/paste your answers directly into Canvas.

- The 9 patterns for the RegEx Golf
- Your score for each hole, and you total score.
- The letter frequency distribution your big chunk of text.
- The 5 most common >= 7 letter word in big chunk of text
- Longest word(s) in big chunk of text
- Your explanation of the validity of the coded messages, for example:
    - code1.txt - random  - your explanation
     ...
    - code5.txt - English - your explanation

Your explanation should be your reasoning why you said the text was
English or garbage.  You should include a line on how confident you
are on each of your assessments.

Deadline: Tuesday Jan 17 - 5pm (-5 pts for each 30 minutes late)
