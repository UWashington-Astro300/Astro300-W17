00 Well, how about a little Red Leicester?
01 Oh, never mind. How are you on Tilsit?
02 Red Windsor?
03 Ah. Stilton?
04 Wensleydale?
05 You do have some cheese, do you?
06 It's not much of a cheese shop really, is it?
07 Now, do you have any cheese at all?

00 I'm, afraid we're fresh out of Red Leicester, sir.
01 Never at the end of the week, sir. Always get it fresh first thing on Monday.
02 Normally, sir, yes, but today the van broke down.
03 Sorry.
04 Yes? Oh! I thought you were talking to me, sir. Mister Wensleydale, that's my name.
05 Certainly, sir. It's a cheese shop, sir.
06 Finest in the district, sir.
07 No.
